== Description
Want to learn something about robotics? This course starts with the basics. You'll build a 2 wheeled robot and hopefully learn something at the same time.

== Objectives 
 * Intro to electricity, motors, microcontrollers. 
 * Learn Encoders
 * Learn PID algorithm
 * Soldering
 * Learn Arduino (C/C++) Coding? This may be emoved to the programming course

== Prerequisites
 * Basic Programming Skills.
 * Any of C/C++ or Python experience s helpful.
