== Abstract
link:http://programmingrobotsstudygroup.github.io/[Programming Robots Study Group] has been a successful program at link:http://robotgarden.org/[Robot Garden]. We've created this series in order to make it a little easier for those who follow.

This series of courses starts with basic concepts and devices. The material is approachable by someone with simple (grade school) programming skills. To make it interesting we've proposed a challenge at the end of the link:Introduction/readme.adoc[Introduction to Robotics] course.

The courses advance to link:http://ros.org/[ROS], link:https://www.ubuntu.com/[Ubuntu (linux)] and other topics which may be more appropriate for those with secondary and post secondary education. 

== Beginner Objectives

* Functional understanding of microcontrollers
* Build a robot capable of competing in table top and indoor challenges.

== Advanced Objectives
* Abilty to stand up and deploy ROS systems
* Ability to code complex algorithms for sensors, etc.
